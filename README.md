My Awesome C++ List : Quick Notes.

# Blogs & Conferences
* CPPCON : The Best conference for C++ : https://github.com/CppCon


# Memory Management

* Jonathan MÃ¼ller (alias FooNathan), explain how to create cache friendly structures : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz9SiF0QVKY

# Performance 
 * Richard Fabian's book on Data Oriented Design : https://www.dataorienteddesign.com/dodbook/ ... it's free !
 
 # Modern C++
 
* experiments of move constructors and noexept attribute in containers ... quite instructive : http://www.hlsl.co.uk/blog/2017/12/1/c-noexcept-and-move-constructors-effect-on-performance-in-stl-containers

## Polygon Triangulation

* The famous "Triangle" Librarry by Jonathan Richard Shewchuck <3 : http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html (Constrained Delaunay with robust predicates)
* Extended Ear Clipping methods that can handle holes : https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp (header only, non Delaunay triangulation, non robust...but can be patched to be robust ?)
* J Ratcliff "Efficient Polygon Triangulation" on Flipcode (do not handle hole, code is a bit old ...) : https://www.flipcode.com/archives/Efficient_Polygon_Triangulation.shtml
* A review of some polygon implementations available to sue on VTerrain by Ben Discoe : http://vterrain.org/Implementation/Libs/triangulate.html
* **Anyone has tried to implement or know an opensourse implementation of the Bernard Chazelle's "Triangulating a Simple Polygon in Linear Time" algorithm ?** https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/pubs/polygon-triang.pdf
